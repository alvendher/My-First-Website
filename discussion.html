  <h2>1. Lion’s Mane Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Cyanea capillata)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The lion’s mane jellyfish is the largest species of jellyfish, with some
	  specimens coming close to the size of a blue whale. The biggest recorded
      lion’s mane jellyfish had a seven-foot (2.13 m) diameter bell and 112 feet
      (34.13 m) long tentacles. Their name comes from the approximately 1,200
      tentacles that make up their mane.
	  <br><br>
	  Lion’s mane jellyfish are mostly found floating in the open ocean in the
	  Arctic and North Pacific Oceans. Lion’s mane jellyfish are bioluminescent
	  and have tentacles covered in millions of stinging cells, holding venom that
	  can be very painful to humans. But since they’re mostly found in cold water,
	  lion’s mane jellyfish don’t normally interact with humans.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
	
  <h2>2. Upside-Down Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Cassiopea sp.)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  Upside-down jellyfish act differently than most jellyfish. Instead of floating
	  bell-up through the ocean, they sit with their bell on the ground, extending
	  their tentacles up to catch food.  Upside-down jellyfish are usually found in
	  sheltered coastal areas of tropical waters around the world. 
	  <br><br>
	  Upside-down jellyfish have a unique defense and hunting mechanism.
	  These jellyfish release mucus filled with nematocysts into the water to
	  capture prey and ward off predators. While the venom from a single upside-
	  down jellyfish isn’t very strong, once one jellyfish releases envenomated
	  mucus the rest of the colony follows suit, making the water dangerous for
	  small fish. 
	  <br><br>
	  People snorkeling through these waters have reported a slight stinging
	  sensation in the water, likely caused by the upside-down jellyfish’s mucus.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
	
  <h2>3. Moon Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Aurelia aurita)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  Moon jellyfish are one of the most common jellyfish and can be found in
	  coastal waters of all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. They have distinctive
	  half circles on the bell which are reproductive tissues. Their sting is not
	  strong enough to penetrate human skin so they’re safe to touch, making
	  moon jellyfish common aquarium species. 
	  <br><br>
	  Moon jellyfish are bioluminescent and glow a light purple when bumped in
	  the dark. Moon jellyfish are one of the species most commonly eaten by people.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
	
  <h2>4. Nomura Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Nemopilema nomurai)</i></h2>
    <section>
	  <p>
	  One of the largest species of jellyfish, the Nomura jellyfish can grow up to
	  six feet (1.82 m) in diameter and usually weigh over 400 pounds (181.43
	  kg). Nomura jellyfish are found in the seas between China and Japan and
	  often create jellyfish blooms that decimate fish populations. 
	  <br><br>
	  Nomura jellyfish have become such a big problem for China and Japan that
	  special research teams have been formed to understand why this species
	  grows so large and how the population can be reduced to a safer level. 
	  <br><br>
	  These scientists believe Nomura jellyfish are able to grow so large from a
	  combination of hydroelectric projects and farming along the Yangtze river
	  that have created enriched nutrient habitats in the Sea of Japan. 
	 <br><br>
	  While it should be easy to remove jellyfish blooms from the water, Nomura
	  jellyfish have a special defense mechanism. When they feel threatened they
	  release billions of sperm and eggs which attach to the ocean floor and grow
	  into more jellyfish.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
	
  <h2>5. Deep Red Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Crossota norvegica)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  Little is known about the deep red jellyfish because their habitat is hard to
	  reach. Deep red jellyfish are found deep in the water of the Arctic Sea,
	  3,000 feet (914.4 m) or more below the surface. These jellyfish are much
	  smaller than many other species, reaching a diameter of only two
	  centimeters (0.78 inches). 
	  <br><br>
	  Deep red jellyfish don’t go through a polyp phase and it’s unknown whether
	  they reproduce sexually or asexually. Because of all of these unique
	  characteristics, the deep red jellyfish has been described as alien-like by
	  scientists.
	  <br><br>
	  </p> 
	</section>
	
  <h2>6. Four-Handed Box Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Chiropsalmus quadrumanus)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The four-handed box jellyfish is found in the West Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of
	  Mexico, and the Pacific Ocean. This jellyfish is transparent and has a bell
	  about the size of a fist with tentacles up to 13 feet long (3.96 m). 
	  <br><br>
	  The four-handed box jellyfish is known for its venomous sting which can be
	  lethal to small children and has been known to kill people within minutes of
	  being stung. 
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
 
  <h2>7. Sea Wasp Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Chironex fleckerii)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The sea wasp jellyfish is found in the coastal waters of Australia and
	  Southeast Asia.  This is the largest cubozoan jellyfish with a bell of
	  approximately eight inches (20.32 cm) and tentacles up to ten feet long (3.04 m). 
	  <br><br>
	  The sea wasp is the most venomous jellyfish and produces the strongest
	  and fastest reaction of any venomous animal. Contact with the ten-foot
	  (3.04 m) tentacles causes immediate pain followed by cardiac failure,
	  leading to death of the prey within a few minutes time.  This venom is best
	  suited for capturing prey and isn’t useful to deter predators, so sea wasps
	  are a common food source for leatherback turtles and other large sea creatures. 
	  <br><br>
	  Scientists are researching why the sea wasp jellyfish’s venom is so
	  powerful, and have found a special component of the venom that drills
	  holes in the victim’s red blood cells. Through clinical trials researchers are
	  getting closer to producing an antidote to the sea wasp jellyfish’s venom.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>

  <h2>8. Immortal Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Turritopsis dohrnii)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The immortal jellyfish is smaller than a pinky nail with a red stomach visible
	  in the middle of its transparent bell.  This jellyfish is found in temperate to
	  tropical waters around the world. 
	  <br><br>
	  As the common name suggests, this species of jellyfish is thought to be
	  immortal due to their unique life cycle. Instead of completing the life cycle
	  and dying after the medusae phase, the Turritopsis dohrnii settles on the
	  seafloor and becomes polyps again, which spawn new clones of the original jellyfish. 
	  <br><br>
	  This life cycle quirk isn’t just seen at the natural end of their life, but is also
	  used as a defense mechanism. When threatened by predators or
	  starvation, this jellyfish transforms back into a polyp and starts over again.
	  This cellular process is called transdifferentiation and is being researched
	  by scientists for its potential applications in the medical field. 
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
  
  <h2>9. Mangrove Box Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Tripedalia cystophora)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The mangrove box jellyfish is found on the seafloor in coastal mangrove
	  forests in Central America. They are relatively small in size, with a bell the
	  size of a grape and tentacles about an inch long. 
	  <br><br>
	  While they are closely related to the sea wasp and other highly venomous
	  box jellyfish, their venom is not harmful to people. Mangrove box jellyfish
	  are facing habitat loss because mangrove forests are among the most
	  threatened ecosystems in the world
	  <br><br>
	  These mangrove forests are cleared for development, agriculture, and fish
	  farming, leaving the mangrove box jellyfish with no suitable habitat.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
 
  <h2>10. Crystal Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Aequorea victoria)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  Crystal jellyfish are found in the Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea to
	  Southern California.  These nearly transparent jellyfish grow up to ten
	  inches (25.4 cm) in diameter with long, wispy tentacles. 
	  <br><br>
	  While crystal jellyfish appear clear, they use bioluminescence and glow
	  green-blue when bumped. The bioluminescent cells from crystal jellyfish
	  have been used as genetic markers by scientists studying genes. 
	  <br><br>
	  Crystal jellyfish can eat prey up to half their body size by using their
	  specialized mouth.  They are common prey species for larger creatures like
	  ocean sunfish, which can be problematic. Plastic bags and other trash
	  floating in the water look just like crystal jellyfish, causing problems for the
	  species that eat them.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
 
  <h2>11. Black Sea Nettle <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Chrysaora achlyos)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The black sea nettle is one of the giant jellyfish species, with bells reaching
	  over three feet (0.91 m) in diameter and tentacles reaching twenty-five feet
	  (7.62 m) in length.  Little is known about the black sea nettle because
	  they’re deep-sea dwellers and are difficult to raise in captivity. 
	  <br><br>
	  They have been known to form dangerous blooms in San Diego Bay and
	  are usually found off the southern coast of California and down the Pacific
	  Coast of Mexico. 
	  <br><br>
	  Black sea nettles have been observed to provide both food and protection
	  for Pacific butterfish: the butterfish eat the plankton gathered by the black
	  sea nettle and hide inside the jellyfish’s bell when danger is near.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
 
  <h2>12. Fried Egg Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Cotylorhiza tuberculata)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  The fried egg jellyfish gets its name from the distinctive yellow circle on the
	  center of their bell. They are also called Mediterranean jellyfish and only live
	  for six months, from summer to winter, and die when the water gets colder. 
	  <br><br>
	  They are primarily found in the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Aegean Seas
	  and grow to approximately sixteen inches (40.64 cm) in diameter. They
	  have a mild sting that usually doesn’t have an effect on people, and have
	  been known to transport small animals like crabs on top of and inside their bell.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
  
  <h2>13. Atolla Jellyfish (<i style="color:#AD0134";>(Atolla wyvillei)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  Atolla jellyfish are found in the deepest parts of the ocean all over the world.
	  Living between 3,280-13,000 feet (999.74 – 3,962.4 m) below the surface,
	  atolla jellyfish live in the midnight zone of the ocean and use
	  bioluminescence to deter predators instead of to attract prey. 
	  <br><br>
	  With a bell diameter of about six inches (15.24 cm), the atolla jellyfish’s
	  natural red coloring acts as camouflage in the deep sea. When threatened
	  they use bioluminescence to flash a bright blue to startle predators.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
 
  <h2>14. Cauliflower Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Cephea cephea)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  Cauliflower jellyfish or crown jellyfish are found in subtropical oceans
	  throughout the world and have a bell approximately seven inches (17.78
	  cm) in diameter.  While they are one of the most venomous jellyfish, their
	  venom is not harmful to humans. 
	  <br><br>
	  These jellyfish move up and down throughout the ocean, spending the
	  daytime deep in the water and coming closer to the surface at night. They
	  are also bioluminescent and glow when threatened by predators.
	  Cauliflower jellyfish are commonly eaten by people in Japan and China and
	  have even been used for medical purposes.
	  <br><br>
	  </p>  
	</section>
 
  <h2>15. White-Spotted Jellyfish <i style="color:#AD0134";>(Phyllorhiza punctata)</i></h2>
	<section>
	  <p>
	  White-spotted jellyfish are found in tropical waters of the western Pacific
	  Ocean. They’re named for the distinctive white spots on their bell and
	  tentacles. While they do have venom, white-spotted jellyfish aren’t harmful
	  to humans and don’t use venom to capture their food. Instead, these
	  jellyfish are filter feeders and eat mostly microscopic zooplankton. 
	  <br><br>
	  White-spotted jellyfish often form blooms that disrupt local ecosystems by
	  removing all of the plankton in the water. These jellyfish become invasive
	  species in areas with no marine snails, the most common predator of white-
	  spotted jellyfish.

	<article>
	<blockquote cite="https://juantripatatime.blogspot.com/2017/10/manila-ocean-park-look-into-dancing-sea.html">
		One of the best attractions of Manila Ocean Park is the Jellies: 
		Dancing Sea Fairies Exhibit. The exhibit may only be spread into 
		two sections but it will definitely provide a whole new experience
		for visitors. 
		<br><br>
		The look and feel of the attraction is inspired by the jellies'
		translucent bodies and their ability to catch light in fascinating
		and beautiful ways. The cylindrical and wall mounted aquariums are 
		equipped with lighting effects and breathtaking music. This design 
		captures the majestic beauty of the jellies as they gracefully drift
		in circles within the tanks. Moreover, these tanks are housed in two
		dark rooms installed with infinity mirrors. The reflections create 
		the effect of being swarmed by these colorful and fragile sea fairies.
		<h2>Trivia:</h2>
		<section>
			The Jellies Exhibit opened in September 2010. So far, it is 
			the only facility in the Philippines to have successfully completed 
			the life cycle of five jellies species in their in-house breeding program. 
			It has gained international recognition when it has sent more than a thousand 
			sea jellies to Underwater World Pattaya in Thailand.
